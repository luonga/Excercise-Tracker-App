Excercise Tracker App

A Single Page Application that tracks the user's excercises.  The user can add, edit, or delete excercises.  I used React for the front-end UI app and a REST API using Node and Express for the back-end web service.  MongoDB was used for persistence.

How to run the application:
Browse to luongan_rest and run npm install and then npm start to connect to MongoDB using Mongoose
Open a new terminal and browse to luongan_react and run npm start
The app will launch on http://localhost:8000/
